Develop an ordering system for Pizza Adriano.

Any ordered pizza can have a set of extra ingredients/cheeses, meat and vegetables/. Any group of ingredients has a limit of components that can be had in an order.

The ordering workflow for the user is as follows:

- The user inputs their name
- The user can select the components of a pizza
- The user looks at the order and its price
- The order can be disapproved and reviewed by the user (clicking 'back')
- The user can finalize the order
- When the order is finalized, a unique 3-digit ID is generated for the order

Develop a desktop application that would allow the user to go through all the steps.


For testing the application, I used JUnit.
